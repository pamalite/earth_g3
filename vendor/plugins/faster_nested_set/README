FasterNestedSet
===============

This is another nested set implementation for RoR.  Its main
advantage over existing implementations is that it allows for
deferred inserts (large subtrees can be inserted in one go where
other implementations incur a full table update for each individual
inserted node), a more natural API (there's no need to pay
attention to outdated left/right values in nodes), and that it only 
uses one update statement per insertion/deletion/move operation 
instead of two.
