========= IMPORTANT NOTICE - READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING THE TEST ===========

This document briefly describes the modifications and current status of the
daemon test script (dtest.rb) which is a lean and less comprehensive version 
of the original daemon_test.rb script.


TESTING NOTES (REQUIREMENTS)

1. Ensure that the test data inserted into the database during the execution
   of the unit tests are removed. The earth_test database should just be an 
   empty data container but with all the relevant tables and relationship 
   intact.

2. Create a test directory over which the testing script will be working on.
   Please ensure that you have write access to this directory and that it
   is initially empty. The test script will DESTROY this directory when it
   is executed.

3. Testing of the caching feature in the daemon is monitored but not acted
   upon (ie. raised assertion ignored). Further investigation of the caching 
   feature is required before this aspect of the test can be implemented.

4. This daemon test script (dtest.rb) was successfully tested on the current
   release of the Earth daemon (r1180). It may require some modifications 
   if the implementation of the daemon is radically altered in future
   releases of Earth.


COMMANDS

1. Testing Over A Specified Number of Iterations

    ./dtest.rb -i nn /path_to_your_test_directory

    where nn = number of iterations


2. Running the Test Over an Infinite Number of Iterations (Stress Testing)

    ./dtest.rb /path_to_your_test_directory

   Note: 
   a) This option will only terminate through user intervention via the
      terminal OR if the test fails due an identified inconsistent state.
   

3. To Run Testing in Debug Mode

    Simply set the flag $debug_mode to true and re-execute the test script.


The above commands are a small subset of the acutal commands and testing 
options in the original daemon testing script (daemon_test.rb).


SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. The following message should appear on the terminal to indicate succesful
   testing with a fixed number of iteration (Command option 1 above):

   ============= DAEMON TEST PASSED (No Assertion raised) =================

    Caching stats: 38/250    [15.2 % ]

   ========================================================================

2. Success of testing using infinite iterations can be measured by how long
   the test runs before it is forcibly teminated by the user via terminal.
